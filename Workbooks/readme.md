Workbooks

+ Core Report Metrics: All the detail we need to know who is using Tableau Server and how it's performing (content-wise). This depends on the All Keys export from your Customer Portal, I've included an empty one for reference.
+ Extract Detail Summary: My version of the Extract Admin view. It shows extract activity, breaks down performance by complete/incomplete, and distribution of errors
+ Style Guide: Superstore-based workbook to help showcase what vizzes should look like using basic best practices and internal style guide.
+ Tableau Key Usage: Postgres + spreasheet to track who is actually using their keys and who to ping to reclaim.
+ TS EVENTS: This is a workbook provided by Matt Coles at TC16. The workbook taps into the Events data source. It's not in use as a workbook, it's the data source you want (logs-lite).
